RNN for time series forecasting
# Time series Data to forecast the feature greeen energy
## Step By Step Procedure 
1. import the dependencies
2. Read the data 
3. As it is time series data used bfill method to handle the missing values 
4. Check the seasonality in data 
5. Check wether the data is stationary or not
6. Created a RNN model
7. Trained the model
8. Tuned the hyper-parameters 
9. forecasted the feature Green energy
